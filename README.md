# Pinball Machine 

The goal of this project was to create a simple pinball machine using an Arduino Uno and household supplies.

## Construction 

The pinball machine is made from birch plywood. The pieces were cut using a handsaw. With a few exceptions, every part is glued together. There are 3 main components of this simple pinball machine: the "flipper," the "launcher," and the "playing field." 

### Flipper

The flipper is constructed from stacked popsicle sticks. It is attached to a servo motor, which is mounted underneath the playing field. Creating an integrated button to move the flipper proved to be a challenge. The finalized design comprises of a popsicle stick, which acts as a simple lever that depresses the button attached to the breadboard under the playing field. Triggering the button is rather simple, as the stick creates a considerable amount of leverage. 

### Launcher

Devising a simple launching mechanism for the ball from household objects was difficult. After much tinkering, an adequate mechanism was created. It uses a spring from a mechanical highlighter, a golf tee, and a plastic cap. 

### Playing field

The pinball machine has a simple playing field. The ball is launched up a channel on the left and into a hole in the back panel. It re-emerges on the right side. If not enough power is applied, the ball will go into the hole, only to roll back to the launcher. There are 2 circular obstacles on the playing field, as well as a rubber band and 2 LED lights that fade on and off. The player looses when the ball falls back into the launch channel.
